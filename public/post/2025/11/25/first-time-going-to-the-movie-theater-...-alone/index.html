    <p>So, I went to the cinema to watch a movie all by myself. Weirdo, right?
<strong>But&hellip;</strong> actually, I think everyone should do it at least once. I might even do it a couple more times.</p>
<h3 id="the-experience">The Experience</h3>
<p>I really, <em>really</em> wanted to watch the new film <strong>&ldquo;Truy Tìm Long Diên Hương,&rdquo;</strong> but I couldn&rsquo;t find anyone with spare time to go with me. So, I thought, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I just go by myself?&rdquo;</p>
<img src = "/images/LDH1.JPG" >
<p>Honestly, it felt really weird at first. I had to tell myself it would be fine—people go places alone all the time, right?</p>
<p>When I arrived at the theater to line up for tickets, it was just couples, couples, and&hellip; more couples. There were some groups of friends mixed in, too. I grabbed my ticket, popcorn, and drink, and quickly ducked into the theater room.</p>
<h3 id="the-sandwich-situation">The &ldquo;Sandwich&rdquo; Situation</h3>
<p>I sat in a row that was initially empty and thought, <em>&ldquo;Wow, finally all alone.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>But I had chosen the middle row (<strong>E6</strong>)—the best seat in the house. A few minutes later, a group of friends sat on my left, and a couple sat on my right. And in between? There was me.</p>
<p>OMG. I immediately started overthinking: <em>When they realize I don&rsquo;t belong to either group, will they think I&rsquo;m incapable of finding even one friend to go with?</em></p>
<h3 id="the-verdict">The Verdict</h3>
<p>Then, the movie started.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I was <strong>more focused</strong> on the film than I usually am when I&rsquo;m with someone. Although I did wish there was someone I could whisper to about the plot twists, it was still a cool experience.</p>
<p>If people think I&rsquo;m weird, fine. I’m weird. But the movie was so good that I didn&rsquo;t mind being alone at all.</p>
<img src = "/images/LDH2.png" >
<p><strong>In total:</strong> Try it yourself. If you want to watch a movie, just go! You don&rsquo;t need to call someone or wait for a partner. It’s actually a great experience.</p>
